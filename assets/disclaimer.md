###### Brief introduction

This assessment is designed to:

- assist your government to assess its capability and capacity to develop a public asset financial protection program, and
- identify priority areas for future action.

###### Assessment structure

The assessment comprises two parts:

- **Part A: Enabling Environment Assessment:**
  This part assesses the extent to which your country’s governmental, policy, economic and social environment is supportive of a public assets financial protection program.

- **Part B: Progress Assessment:**
  If your country’s government intends to develop, or is in the process of developing, a public assets financial protection program, this part assesses the current status of the program development. The results of this assessment allow you to understand your country’s relative strengths and where there may be gaps.

The assessment is conducted against four pillars:

1. Institutional Readiness,
2. Data Readiness,
3. Operational Readiness, and
4. Insurance Market Readiness

###### Outputs

Based on the results of the assessment, you can then identify the areas where you may require technical support in the Scorecard.
